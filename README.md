Abstract:
Increasing demand for electricity in recent years has created new transmission lines for the transfer 
of electrical power from sources of production to the consumer. Therefore, the expansion of power transmission 
lines is inevitable in order to reduce the operating cost and the investing cost in power systems. 
Due to the huge investment required in the planning of the expansion of the transmission network, finding 
the best development plan is very important. In order to develop such a development plan, a detailed and 
fairly complete modeling of the problem should be presented in which the various technical and economic 
constraints are considered. By increasing the penetration of wind power sources in power networks that are 
connected to the transmission network by connecting wind turbines in the form of wind farms, the planning 
and development of the transmission network undergoes a lot of changes. In this thesis, the optimum connection 
of wind farms to the transmission network along with the uncertainty of wind farm output power are two 
important aspects of wind farms in power networks, whose effects have been examined. With this in mind, 
the purpose of this thesis is to investigate the effects of the optimal development of wind resources on 
determining the optimum arrangement of the addition of new lines to the transmission network, taking into 
account the specific economic and security aspects. On the other hand, the existence of uncertainties in 
wind power production is of great importance in determining the configuration of new network lines, 
and it leads to an increase in the risk of uncertain parameters in investing for optimal designs. 
Therefore, Monte-Carlo simulation method is used to model the uncertainties of wind energy production.
